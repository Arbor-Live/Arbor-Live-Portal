# Resend for transactional email

The portal sends transactional email (schedules, invites, booking quotes, band-payment requests, auth flows) through [Resend](https://resend.com). Outbound delivery uses the official [`@convex-dev/resend`](https://www.convex.dev/components/resend) Convex component (for durable, queued sends) alongside the raw `resend` SDK (for sends that carry PDF/ICS attachments).

## Outbound sending

- The component is registered in [`convex.config.ts`](../packages/backend/convex/convex.config.ts) and instantiated in [`email/send.ts`](../packages/backend/convex/email/send.ts) as `resendClient`, with `testMode: process.env.EMAIL_TEST_MODE === "true"`.
- Templates are React Email components rendered to HTML in [`email/templates.ts`](../packages/backend/convex/email/templates.ts); sends are enqueued as Convex actions (see `email/enqueue.ts`, `email/triggers.ts`).
- `From`, reply-to, and CC defaults live in [`email/constants.ts`](../packages/backend/convex/email/constants.ts) and are overridable by env var.
- Schedule-published and crew-scheduled emails are **debounced (~45s)** and keyed by content fingerprint so rapid schedule/crew saves (and day-lead recipients) do not flood the same inbox. Crew notices coalesce to one email per person per event with their full current assignment.
- Fully unassigning someone after they already received a crew invite sends a **crew-unscheduled** email with an ICS `METHOD:CANCEL` attachment (same UID as the invite). Pending schedule emails are dropped; if they are re-assigned before the debounce fires, the cancel email is cancelled instead.

### From-address domain

Resend only delivers from a **verified sending domain**. In the Resend
dashboard: **Domains → Add Domain**, then add the DNS records it lists (SPF,
DKIM). `EMAIL_FROM` (and the payments variants) must use an address on a
verified domain, e.g. `noreply@arbor.st`.

### Outbound environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Yes | Resend API key (`re_...`); used by both the component and the raw SDK |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Yes | Default From address, e.g. `Arbor Notifications <noreply@arbor.st>` |
| `EMAIL_TEST_MODE` | No | `"true"` restricts `@convex-dev/resend` to Resend test addresses (`delivered@…`); those sends still count against Resend quota |
| `E2E_HELPERS` | No (local e2e) | Enables Playwright seed helpers; localhost `SITE_URL` required |
| `E2E_EMAIL_MOCK` | No (local e2e) | With `E2E_HELPERS`, skips Resend entirely after render (no quota). Set by `pnpm test:e2e` |
| `ORGANIZER_EMAIL` | No | Organizer contact shown in emails; defaults to the address in `EMAIL_FROM` |
| `PAYMENTS_EMAIL_FROM` | No | From address for band-payment emails; has a default |
| `BAND_PAYMENTS_CC_EMAIL` | No | CC on band-payment emails; has a default |

```bash
npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY "re_xxxxxxxx"
npx convex env set EMAIL_FROM "Arbor Notifications <noreply@arbor.st>"
# optional overrides
npx convex env set PAYMENTS_EMAIL_FROM "Arbor Live — Financial Manager <payments@arbor.st>"
```

## Band payment emails

Band payouts use outbound-only emails:

1. **Signature request** (`band_payment_confirmation`) — admin sends from the
   payout queue; payee gets a CTA into the band portal to e-sign.
2. **Payee required** — nudges the band when designated payee info is missing.
3. **Submitted for processing** (`band_payment_completed`) — after admin marks
   paid with a transfer / Service Payment number, all active band members are
   notified that Stanford is processing the payout.

Agreement is recorded in-portal (typed legal name + checkbox), not by email
reply. There is no Resend inbound webhook.

## Local testing checklist

1. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` on the Convex deployment.
2. Optionally set `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true` so sends stay in test mode.
3. Trigger a band-payment signature request from Financial Hub → Band Payouts
   and confirm the payee email + portal CTA.
